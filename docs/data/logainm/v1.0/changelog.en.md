## **v1.0.0** / 2020-07-05

This update marks the official public release of the Logainm API.

### Changed

Breaking changes:

- Pagination is now enforced for all requests to API endpoints returning a list of results. If no page parameters are specified the first page of results will be returned with a maximum count of 1,000 results per page. This helps ensure consistent and reliable performance regardless of the total result count.
- All API endpoints returning a list of objects now provide metadata regarding the total count of results and pagination. For reference lists, returned from the `/api/v1.0/administrative-units`, `/api/v1.0/features`, `/api/v1.0/glossary` and `/api/v1.0/counties` endpoints, this means that results are now nested in a `results` property.
- The `places` property of the [`placeList`](/en/data/logainm/v1.0/data) object has been renamed to `results`. This provides better consistency with other list object types.

Other changes:

- Updated documentation and data dictionary to reflect changes.

### Removed

### Deprecated
